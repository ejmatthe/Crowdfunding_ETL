# Crowdfunding_ETL

##Project Overview

This collaborative project focuses on using the ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process on a crowdfunding dataset and loading the created files into a relational database. The main goal was to understand the ETL components relevant to exploring and modifiying databases by employing effective tools and methods that would enable the generation of modified crowdfunding data to meet professional analysis requirements. 

##Resources


##Project Report/Summary

An ETL pipeline was built using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the crowdfunding data from Excel files. Following the data transformation, the data was stored in flat files, namely, four CSV files were created and used to generate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. With these completed the CSV files were loaded into a Postgres SQL database.

##Process

###Extract and Transform
* Data was extracted from the Crowdfunding and Contact Excel files
    '!we can discuss certain codes/functions we used the .reindex, for example...'
###Load

###Takeaways/the why:
The use of an ETL pipeline in this project was optimal because it conveniently facilitates data gathering, processing, and storing in an efficient manner.
